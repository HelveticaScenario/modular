- [x] zeroconf
- [x] license?
- [x] indicator of what file is currently running
- [ ] better way of scaling output to a range? would need to know the period of the oscilator 
- [x] make scope narrower
- [ ] make custom scope for track
- [ ] make seq type (cv + gate with mini (mondo?) notation)
- [ ] make seq scope
- [ ] give scope a speed option, for slow moving signals that need to be seen over long periods
- [ ] reverb (erbe verb?)
- [ ] fix filters
- [ ] other effects (chorus, delay, waveshaper, distortion, etc.)
- [ ] buffer type
- [ ] sample loading into buffer
- [ ] live recording into buffer
- [ ] arbitrary param types (like enum) (not modulatable)
- [ ] polyphony?
- [ ] some sort of "make module" composition system
- [ ] midi in (notes would pretend to be seq, cc would be signal)
- [ ] midi out (no idea how to do this. some sort of sample and hold?)
- [ ] signal in
- [ ] more oscillators
- [ ] more filters
- [ ] more effects
- [ ] more math
- [ ] more utilities
- [ ] more everything
- [ ] pass whole buffers through modules, not just one sample at a time
