Conventions: patch graphs are the contract; update Rust types in modular_core instead of hand-editing TS. For module params: update DSP param structs + validators + rebuild N-API + adjust DSL factories if needed. Prefer Electron APIs over web/React APIs when either could solve a task. Real-time safety in audio callback (no allocations/logging). Voltage convention: 1v/oct (0v is A0); output attenuation in crates/modular/src/audio.rs. Rust 2024 edition; typical Rust style (snake_case, derive Serde).
